  <h2>Squash & Courgette</h2>
    <h3>Did you know?</h3>
      <p>Courgettes and squashes are actually members of the same family of vegetables - the Cucurbitaceae family.</p>
    <h3>Grow</h3>
      <p>Both of these veggies are easy to grow from seed, and they prefer to be started off inside from pots, but can also be sewn directly outdoors. The best time to sew these seeds is April to June.
      <p>Water: These are thirsty plants, so make sure you keep their soil nice and damp.</p>
      <p>Food: To keep these plants happy, feed them every 10-14 days with a high potash liquid fertiliser once the first fruits start to swell.</p>
      <p>Harvesting: Harvest your courgettes and squashes while they are still quite small (10-12cm long) to ensure a long cropping period. Courgettes are best eaten fresh, while a squash can usually last well if kept in a dark spot.</p>
  <h3>Bonus:</h3>
      <p>All parts of the squash family are edible - harvest some of the flowers to add to salads or stuff with goat’s cheese.</p>
  <h3>Goes well with:</h3>
      <p>Fry courgettes for a simple addition to any dish, or try with goat’s cheese or feta. Squashes can work as a delicious side, or as the key ingredient in a warming curry or soup on a cold winter’s evening.</p>

  <h3>Fun fact:</h3>
