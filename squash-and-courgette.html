    <h3>Did you know?</h3>
      <p>Courgettes and squashes are actually members of the same family of vegetables - the Cucurbitaceae family.</p>
    <h3>Grow</h3>
      <p>Both of these veggies are easy to grow from seed, and they prefer to be started off inside from pots, but can also be sewn directly outdoors. The best time to sew these seeds is April to June.
      <p>Water: These are thirsty plants, so make sure you keep their soil nice and damp.</p>
      <p>Food: To keep these plants happy, feed them every 10-14 days with a high potash liquid fertiliser once the first fruits start to swell.</p>
      <p>Harvesting: Harvest your courgettes and squashes while they are still quite small (10-12cm long) to ensure a long cropping period. Courgettes are best eaten fresh, while a squash can usually last well if kept in a dark spot.</p>
  <h3>Bonus:</h3>
      <p>All parts of the squash family are edible - harvest some of the flowers to add to salads or stuff with goat’s cheese.</p>
  <h3>Goes well with:</h3>
      <p>Fry courgettes for a simple addition to any dish, or try with goat’s cheese or feta. Squashes can work as a delicious side, or as the key ingredient in a warming curry or soup on a cold winter’s evening.</p>
  <h3>Recipe:</h3>
      <p>Ingredients:
        <ul>
          <li>½ vegetable stock cube</li>
          <li>200g giant couscous</li>
          <li>3 medium courgettes</li>
          <li>1 lemon</li>
          <li>Handful fresh mint leaves</li>
          <li>50g chopped walnuts</li>
          <li>2 tbsp walnut oil</li>
          <li>4 ripe figs</li>
          <li>125g soft goat’s cheese</li>
        </ul>
        Method:
        <ol>
          <li>Boil the water in a kettle, put the ½ stock cube in a jug, then pour over 200ml hot water and mix well. Put the giant couscous into a large heatproof bowl and pour over the hot stock. Cover with cling film and leave for 20 minutes to soften, or until tender.</li>
          <li>Meanwhile, slice the courgettes into long, thin ribbons. Squeeze over the juice of the lemon and season well, then leave for at least 15 minutes to marinate.</li>
          <li>Chop the mint leaves. When the couscous is soft and has absorbed all or most of the stock, drain if necessary, then toss with the courgettes, chopped mint, walnuts and walnut oil. Season generously.</li>
          <li>Divide the couscous mixture among plates. Slice the figs lengthways. Top each plate with sliced figs, then crumble over the goat’s cheese and serve.</li>
        </ol>
