    <h3>Did you know?</h3>
      <p>The earliest recorded trace of the potato was found in the Peruvian Andes around 6000BC. Potato production increased as the Incas improved their farming production. They were eventually introduced into Europe by the Spanish, following their invasion into Peru in 1532. There are lots of stories about how potatoes arrived to the UK, but we do know that in 1589 Sir Walter Raleigh planted potato seeds on his estate in Cork and then gifted them to Queen Elizabeth I. Throughout the 1800 and 1900s, the potato was spread further across Europe through the hands of sailors. Today there are over a thousand different types of potatoes - and they are the 4th largest food crop on earth!</p>
    <h3>Grow:</h3>
      <p>Plant potatoes in full sun. Potatoes require a cool but frost-free growing season of 75 to 135 or more days. The ideal potato growing temperature is 45° to 80°F. Hot weather will reduce the number of tubers per plant. Potatoes prefer well-drained fertile soil high in organic matter.</p>
      <p>Water: It is best to plant seed potatoes in moist soil but not too wet. As long as the soil does not completely dry out, it is good to wait about 2 weeks for the plants to emerge before watering again. That is when the focus changes from not applying too much water to making sure the soil doesn't dry out.</p>
      <p>Food: Feed regularly with a general purpose feed</p>
      <p>Harvesting: Wait until all the foliage of the plant has withered and died back before harvesting mature potatoes. After the foliage has died, dig up a potato from one or two plants and rub the skin of the potato with your fingers. The skin of a potato that is ready for harvest won't scrub off easily.</p>
  <h3>Bonus:</h3>
      <p>One medium potato with the skin contributes 2 grams of fiber or 8% of the daily value per serving</p>
  <h3>Recipe:</h3>
  <p>Ingredients:
    <ul>
      <li>1kg Maris Piper Potato</li>
      <li>100g duck or goose fat</li>
      <li>2 tsp flour</li>
      <li>Maldon salt to serve</li>
    </ul>
    Method:
    <ol>
      <li>Put a roasting tin in the oven (one big enough to take the potatoes in a single layer) and heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. </li>
      <li>Peel the 1kg potatoes and cut each into 4 even-sized pieces if they are medium size, 2-3 if smaller (5cm pieces).</li>
      <li>Drop the potatoes into a large pan and pour in enough water to barely cover them.</li>
      <li>Add salt, then wait for the water to boil. As soon as the water reaches a full rolling boil, lower the heat, put your timer on and simmer the potatoes uncovered, reasonably vigorously, for 2 mins.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, put 100g duck or goose fat or 100ml olive oil into the hot roasting tin and heat it in the oven for a few mins, so it’s really hot.</li>
      <li>Drain the potatoes in a colander then shake the colander back and forth a few times to fluff up the outsides. Sprinkle with 2 tsp flour and give another shake or two so they are evenly and thinly coated. </li>
      <li>Carefully put the potatoes into the hot fat – they will sizzle as they go in – then turn and roll them around so they are coated all over. Spread them in a single layer making sure they have plenty of room.
          Roast the potatoes for 15 mins, then take them out of the oven and turn them over.</li>
      <li>Roast for another 15 mins and turn them over again. Put them back in the oven for another 10-20 mins, or however long it takes to get them really golden and crisp. The colouring will be uneven, which is what you want. Scatter with Maldon salt and serve straight away.</li>  
    </ol>
